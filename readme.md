## Concerns

- Couldn't this be confusing for developers who don't speak english as a first language?

I think it could be confusing for developers who only speak english.

- Isn't this a bit over engineered? Did you really need to write tests for this? Like, why would anyone need any of this?

I don't know, maybe it will show up on hacker news or something?
